# Golang Toy Robot

I am using this as a tool to learn golang.

The app is a CLI that models a robot moving about on a 5x5 table.

## Valid commands

```
PLACE 1,1,NORTH
MOVE
LEFT
RIGHT
REPORT
```

## Status

1. Get something that works, without worrying too much about go idioms.
2. CURRENT - Update to be idiomatic go code, unless there is a good reason.
3. Polish and finish.
